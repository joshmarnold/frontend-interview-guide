This comprehensive resource is designed to help prepare effectively for frontend interviews by providing a wide range of topics, examples and practice problems.

## Goal of this Guide

In the limited time available for interview preparation, the goal is to offer a focused and efficient approach to help maximize learning and readiness. This guide aims to:

- Provide all the necessary content in one place, eliminating the need to search across multiple sites.
- Offer a simple and user-friendly layout for easy navigation and understanding.
- Focus on essential content relevant to frontend interviews, avoiding unnecessary fluff.
- Carefully select examples and questions that introduce new ideas, techniques and problem-solving approaches.
- Ensure all content is freely accessible without any locked or restricted material.

## Repository Structure

This repository consists of two main directories:

1. `practice-problems`: This directory contains a collection of practice problems related to algorithms, data structures, and UI.

2. `web-ui`: This directory houses the website for the Frontend Software Engineer Interview Guide.

Each are seen as seperate domains. `web-ui` is create react app where you'll need to install deps and run the app. practice problems is just simple html files that you open in the browser.

## Getting Started

### For Users

If you're interested in using the Frontend Software Engineer Interview Guide to prepare for your interviews, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/joshmarnold/frontend-interview-guide.git`

2. Open the `practice-problems` directory in your preferred code editor.

3. To run any of the practice problems, simply open the corresponding HTML file in a web browser. For example, to run the accordion problem, open the `accordion.html` file.

4. If you're using Visual Studio Code (VSCode), it's recommended to install the "Live Server" extension for a better development experience:

- With the "Live Server" extension, you can start a local server by right-clicking on any HTML file and selecting "Open with Live Server".
- This will automatically open the selected file in your default web browser.
- The live server will be started on port 5500 and will serve the file. Alternatively you can also start the server from the root directory of the repository.
- You can navigate through the directories and files served by the live server directly in your browser. This is what I do. I just click "Go Live" on bottom right.

5. To run the algorithm practice problems, open the `algo` directory and run the `index.html` file.

- The `index.html` file references the "runner" script, which contains an array of functions or problems that will be executed.
- The output of the algorithm problems will be displayed in the browser's console.
