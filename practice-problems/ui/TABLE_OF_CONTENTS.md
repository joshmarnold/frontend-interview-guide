# UI Practice Problems

## Introduction

The `practice-problems` directory consists of a collection of UI-related practice problems designed to help you improve your frontend development skills. Each problem is intended to be solved using both vanilla JavaScript and React. This is due to the expectation in many interview sitatuations to use vanilla JS without libraries or frameworks. Typically, the structure should follow:

problem-name/
├── vanilla.html
└── react.html


To make it easier for you to get started with the practice problems, we have set up the React implementations to use a CDN (Content Delivery Network) to fetch the necessary React libraries. This eliminates the need for you to install any additional dependencies or set up a complex development environment.

However, please note that the primary focus is on implementing the problems using vanilla JavaScript. As a result, some problems may not have a corresponding React implementation. The vanilla JavaScript solutions will help you understand the core concepts and logic behind each problem.

To run and test your implementations, simply open the corresponding HTML file for each problem in a web browser. If you're using Visual Studio Code (VSCode), we recommend installing the "Live Server" extension. This extension allows you to launch a local development server and automatically reloads the page whenever you make changes to your code.

By working through these practice problems, you'll gain hands-on experience in building UI components, handling user interactions, and applying frontend development best practices. Feel free to explore the problems, implement your solutions, and compare them with the provided solutions to enhance your understanding and proficiency in frontend development.

Happy coding and enjoy the practice problems!
