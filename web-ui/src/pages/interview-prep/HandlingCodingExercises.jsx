        <h2>Clarify</h2>
        <p>
          Many of the questions are designed to be open-ended to provide insight
          into your problem solving ability. They use these insights to learn
          how you probe for data when developing a solution. They're looking to
          see you engage with the problem, break it down into smaller
          components, and manage your time effectively. Many of these problems
          can seem too large to be solved within the time-frame of an interview,
          so make sure you narrow the scope and clarify your expectations. Be
          sure to talk through your thought process and ask questions for
          clarification.

        <h2>Explain</h2>
        <p>
          They want to understand how you think, so be sure to explain your
          thought process and decision making throughout the interview. Remember
          they're not only evaluating your technical ability, but also how you
          approach problems and solve them. Your reasoning behind decisions is
          just as important as the solutions themselves. Call out the tradeoffs
          you are considering, and the pros and cons of the options you are
          exploring.

      <section>
        <h2>Improve</h2>
        <p>
          Think about ways to improve or scale the solution you present. It's
          important to think out loud about your initial thoughts to a question
          and engage the interviewer. In many cases, your first answer may need
          some refining and further explanation. If necessary, start with the
          brute force solution and improve on it. Be sure to let the interviewer
          know your approach and be explicit about the tradeoffs you make.

      <section>
        <h2>Practice</h2>
        <p>
          During the interview you won't have access to an IDE or compiler.
          Practice writing code without the benefit of your editor or a browser
          (in a plaintext editor or on a piece of paper). Be sure to focus on
          the right data structure and test cases. Ensure your code is easily
          readable without bugs. Don't worry about small syntactical errors like
          which sub-string to use for a given method (e.g. start, end or start,
          length) â€” pick one and discuss it with your interviewer to let them
          know.
