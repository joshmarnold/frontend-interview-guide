          This section provides guidance on how to approach coding exercises
          during technical interviews. It's essential to understand what the
          interviewer is looking for. The goal is to demonstrate your problem
          solving and coding skills, as well as your ability to communicate and
          collaborate with the interviewer. They want to see what it's like to
          work with you and how you approach problems.

          Skipping or rushing through the problem-solving process can be a
          costly mistake during a coding interview. If you overlook the Clarify
          and Explain sections and dive straight into writing code, you may
          severely jeopardize your chances of getting the job. It's crucial to
          recognize that interviewers are not solely interested in your final
          solution; they place significant emphasis on your thought process and
          problem-solving approach.

          The following sections provide a framework for handling coding
          exercises during technical interviews.

        <h2>Clarify</h2>
        <p>
          Interview questions are often open-ended to assess your
          problem-solving skills. Interviewers use these questions to understand
          how you gather information and approach problem-solving. They want to
          see you actively engage with the problem, break it down into
          manageable parts, and effectively allocate your time. Some problems
          may seem too complex to solve within the given time frame, so it's
          crucial to narrow down the scope and clarify your assumptions.
          Remember to verbalize your thought process and ask clarifying
          questions when needed.

      <section>
        <h2>Explain</h2>
        <p>
          Interviewers are interested in understanding your thought process, so
          make sure to explain your reasoning and decision-making throughout the
          interview. They evaluate not only your technical skills but also your
          problem-solving approach. Your rationale behind decisions is as
          crucial as the solutions themselves. Discuss the trade-offs you are
          considering and the advantages and disadvantages of the options you
          are exploring.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Improve</h2>
        <p>
          Consider ways to optimize or scale the solution you propose. It's
          essential to think aloud about your initial ideas and engage with the
          interviewer. Often, your first answer may require refinement and
          further explanation. If needed, start with a brute-force solution and
          then iterate and improve upon it. Clearly communicate your approach to
          the interviewer and be transparent about the trade-offs you are
          making.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Practice</h2>
        <p>
          During the interview, it's possible that you won't have access to an
          IDE or compiler. Practice writing code without relying on your code
          editor or a browser. Use a plain text editor or pen and paper to
          simulate the interview environment. Focus on selecting the appropriate
          data structures and creating test cases. Ensure your code is readable
          and free of obvious bugs. Don't worry about minor syntax errors.
          Choose one and discuss it with your interviewer to demonstrate your
          awareness.
