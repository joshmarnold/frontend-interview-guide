      <p>
        A graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices (or nodes)
        and edges. Vertices are the fundamental units of the graph, and edges
        are the connections between the vertices. Graphs are used to represent
        relationships and connections between objects.
      </p>

      <h3>Types of Graphs</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Undirected Graph:</strong> In an undirected graph, the edges
          do not have a specific direction. If an edge connects vertex A to
          vertex B, it implies that B is also connected to A.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Directed Graph:</strong> In a directed graph (or digraph), the
          edges have a specific direction. If an edge connects vertex A to
          vertex B, it does not necessarily mean that B is connected to A.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Weighted Graph:</strong> In a weighted graph, each edge has an
          associated weight or cost. The weight represents some value or cost
          associated with traversing that edge.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Graph Representation</h3>
      <p>
        Graphs can be represented in different ways, depending on the
        requirements and characteristics of the graph. Two common
        representations are:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Adjacency List:</strong> An adjacency list is a collection of
          lists or arrays, where each list represents a vertex, and the elements
          in the list represent the vertices that are connected to it. In a
          weighted graph, each element in the list is a pair of the connected
          vertex and the weight of the edge.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Adjacency Matrix:</strong> An adjacency matrix is a 2D array
          where the rows and columns represent the vertices, and the values in
          the matrix represent the presence or absence of an edge between the
          vertices. In an undirected graph, the matrix is symmetric along the
          diagonal. In a weighted graph, the values in the matrix represent the
          weights of the edges.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Graph Traversal</h3>
      <p>
        Graph traversal is the process of visiting all the vertices in a graph.
        There are two common algorithms for graph traversal:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Depth-First Search (DFS):</strong> DFS explores as far as
          possible along each branch before backtracking. It uses a stack (or
          recursion) to keep track of the vertices to visit.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Breadth-First Search (BFS):</strong> BFS explores all the
          neighboring vertices at the current depth before moving on to the
          vertices at the next depth level. It uses a queue to keep track of the
          vertices to visit.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <strong>Choosing Between DFS and BFS</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The choice between using DFS or BFS for graph traversal depends on the
        specific requirements of the task at hand. Here are some considerations:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>DFS:</strong> Depth-First Search is preferable when the goal
          is to visit every vertex in the graph and there are no constraints on
          memory usage. It is particularly useful for problems where we need to
          explore all possible paths or when looking for components that are far
          from the starting point, such as solving mazes or pathfinding in
          games.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>BFS:</strong> Breadth-First Search is the better choice for
          finding the shortest path between two vertices, especially in graphs
          of unknown or infinite size, like networks or in puzzles like word
          ladders. It is also beneficial when memory usage is not a constraint,
          as it may require storing all vertices at the current frontier in the
          queue.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Ultimately, the choice may come down to the specific requirements of the
        problem, such as whether finding the shortest path is necessary or if
        the algorithm's memory consumption is a concern.
