      <p>
        A trie, also known as a prefix tree, is a tree-like data structure used
        to store and retrieve strings efficiently. It is particularly useful for
        tasks involving string searches and prefix matching. The name "trie"
        comes from the word "retrieval" because the structure allows for quick
        retrieval of strings based on their prefixes.
      </p>

      <h3>Characteristics of a Trie</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Each node in a trie represents a character or a prefix of a string.
        </li>
        <li>The root node represents an empty string.</li>
        <li>Each edge between nodes represents a character.</li>
        <li>
          The children of a node represent the next characters that can follow
          the current prefix.
        </li>
        <li>
          A node may have multiple children, each corresponding to a different
          character.
        </li>
        <li>
          The end of a string is usually marked by a special character or a
          boolean flag in the corresponding node.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Advantages of a Trie</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Efficient Prefix Matching:</strong> Tries allow for fast
          prefix matching. By traversing the trie from the root node and
          following the edges corresponding to the characters in the prefix, we
          can quickly determine if a string with the given prefix exists in the
          trie.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Efficient String Searches:</strong> Tries provide efficient
          string searches, especially when dealing with a large number of
          strings. The time complexity of searching for a string in a trie is
          proportional to the length of the string, rather than the total number
          of strings stored in the trie.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Space Efficiency:</strong> Tries can be space-efficient,
          especially when storing a large number of strings with shared
          prefixes. Since common prefixes are shared among multiple strings,
          tries can reduce the overall space required compared to storing each
          string independently.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Applications of Tries</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Autocomplete and Predictive Text:</strong> Tries are commonly
          used for implementing autocomplete and predictive text features. By
          storing words or phrases in a trie, we can efficiently retrieve all
          strings with a given prefix, enabling quick suggestions as users type.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Dictionary and Spell Checkers:</strong> Tries can be used to
          build dictionary data structures and spell checkers. By storing valid
          words in a trie, we can efficiently check if a given word exists in
          the dictionary or suggest corrections for misspelled words.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>IP Routing Tables:</strong> Tries can be used to store and
          search IP routing tables efficiently. Each node in the trie represents
          a part of an IP address, allowing for fast longest prefix matching
          when routing packets.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Text Search and Pattern Matching:</strong> Tries can be used
          for efficient text search and pattern matching. By constructing a trie
          of the text or patterns, we can quickly find all occurrences of a
          given pattern in the text.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Trie Operations</h3>
      <p>The main operations performed on a trie are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Insertion:</strong> Adding a new string to the trie by
          creating or following the appropriate nodes and edges.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Search:</strong> Checking if a given string exists in the trie
          by traversing the trie and matching characters.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Prefix Matching:</strong> Finding all strings with a given
          prefix by traversing the trie and collecting the strings that follow
          the prefix.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Deletion:</strong> Removing a string from the trie by
          traversing the trie and removing unnecessary nodes and edges.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Tries provide an efficient way to store and retrieve strings based on
        their prefixes. While the implementation details of a trie can vary
        depending on the specific requirements and programming language, the
        basic concepts remain the same.
      </p>

      <p>
        When working with large datasets of strings and performing frequent
        prefix-based operations, tries can significantly improve the performance
        compared to other data structures like hash tables or binary search
        trees.
