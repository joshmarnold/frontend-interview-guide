        Project management frameworks provide structured approaches for
        front-end engineers to align their development work with a project's
        overall strategy. They define the stages, activities, and principles
        that guide teams to deliver successful outcomes effectively.

      <h3>PDLC (Project Development Life Cycle)</h3>
      <p>
        PDLC is a framework that outlines the stages a project goes through from
        initiation to closure. It typically includes phases such as initiation,
        planning, execution, monitoring and control, and closure. PDLC provides
        a high-level overview of the project's lifecycle and helps ensure that
        all necessary activities are performed in a structured manner.
      </p>

      <h4>Phases of PDLC</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Initiation:</strong> In this phase, the project is
          conceptualized, and the project charter is created. The frontend
          engineer, as a leader, would be involved in defining the project's
          objectives, scope, and high-level requirements. They would collaborate
          with stakeholders to identify the project's feasibility and align it
          with business goals.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Planning:</strong> During the planning phase, the project team
          creates a detailed project plan, including timelines, resource
          allocation, and deliverables. The frontend engineer leader would
          contribute to the planning process by defining the technical
          requirements, estimating efforts, and identifying potential risks and
          dependencies. They would also help in creating a work breakdown
          structure and assigning tasks to team members.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Execution:</strong> In the execution phase, the project team
          carries out the planned activities and develops the deliverables. The
          frontend engineer leader would oversee the development process,
          ensuring that the team follows best practices and coding standards.
          They would provide technical guidance, conduct code reviews, and
          facilitate collaboration among team members. The rest of the frontend
          team would focus on implementing the user interface, integrating with
          backend services, and ensuring a smooth user experience.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Monitoring and Control:</strong> Throughout the project, the
          team monitors progress, tracks metrics, and manages risks and issues.
          The frontend engineer leader would regularly review the project's
          status, identify any deviations from the plan, and take corrective
          actions if necessary. They would also communicate progress to
          stakeholders and ensure that the project stays on track. The frontend
          team would actively participate in testing, bug fixing, and
          performance optimization.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Closure:</strong> In the closure phase, the project is
          formally concluded, and the deliverables are handed over to the client
          or stakeholders. The frontend engineer leader would be involved in
          preparing the final documentation, conducting post-project reviews,
          and gathering feedback. They would also facilitate knowledge transfer
          and ensure that the project's lessons learned are documented for
          future reference. The frontend team would assist in creating user
          guides, conducting user training, and providing support during the
          transition period.
