        Project management frameworks provide structured approaches for all
        stakeholders involved in a project, including product managers,
        designers, and front-end engineers, to align their work with the
        project's overall strategy. These frameworks define the stages,
        activities, and principles that guide teams to deliver successful
        outcomes effectively.

      <h3>PDLC (Project Development Life Cycle)</h3>
      <p>
        PDLC is a framework that outlines the stages a project goes through from
        initiation to closure. It typically includes phases such as initiation,
        planning, execution, monitoring and control, and closure. PDLC provides
        a high-level overview of the project's lifecycle and helps ensure that
        all necessary activities are performed in a structured manner.
      </p>

      <h4>Phases of PDLC</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Initiation:</strong> In this phase, the product manager
          conceptualizes the project and creates the project charter. They
          define the project's objectives, scope, and high-level requirements in
          collaboration with stakeholders. The product manager assesses the
          project's feasibility and aligns it with business goals. The front-end
          engineer, along with other technical leads, may provide input on
          technical feasibility and initial estimates.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Planning:</strong> During the planning phase, the project
          team, led by the product manager, creates a detailed project plan.
          This includes defining timelines, resource allocation, and
          deliverables. The product manager works closely with the design team
          to create user stories, wireframes, and mockups. The front-end
          engineer contributes to the planning process by providing technical
          insights, estimating efforts, and identifying potential risks and
          dependencies.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Execution:</strong> In the execution phase, the project team
          carries out the planned activities and develops the deliverables. The
          design team finalizes the user interface designs and hands them off to
          the front-end engineering team. The front-end engineer, along with the
          rest of the frontend team, focuses on implementing the user interface,
          integrating with backend services, and ensuring a smooth user
          experience. The product manager oversees the development process,
          tracks progress, and coordinates with other stakeholders.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Monitoring and Control:</strong> Throughout the project, the
          product manager monitors progress, tracks metrics, and manages risks
          and issues. They regularly review the project's status, identify any
          deviations from the plan, and take corrective actions if necessary.
          The front-end engineer and the team actively participate in testing,
          bug fixing, and performance optimization. The product manager
          communicates progress to stakeholders and ensures that the project
          stays on track.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Closure:</strong> In the closure phase, the project is
          formally concluded, and the deliverables are handed over to the client
          or stakeholders. The product manager, along with the project team,
          prepares the final documentation, conducts post-project reviews, and
          gathers feedback. The front-end engineer assists in creating user
          guides and provides support during the transition period. The team
          documents the project's lessons learned for future reference.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Throughout the PDLC, the product manager plays a central role in
        coordinating the efforts of various stakeholders, including designers,
        front-end engineers, and other team members. The front-end engineer
        contributes to the project's success by providing technical expertise,
        implementing the user interface, and ensuring a high-quality user
        experience. Effective collaboration and communication among all
        stakeholders are crucial for the successful execution of the project.
