      <p>
        Project initiation is the first phase of a project where the project's
        purpose, objectives, and scope are defined. It's crucial for front-end
        engineers to understand these concepts as they play a key role in the
        success of a project.
      </p>

      <h3>Charter</h3>
      <p>
        A project charter is a document that formally authorizes the project and
        outlines its high-level objectives, stakeholders, and deliverables. It
        serves as a reference point throughout the project lifecycle. A team may
        also use it to secure funding or resources.
      </p>

      <h3>Objectives vs Goals</h3>
      <p>
        Objectives are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and
        time-bound (SMART) targets that define what the project aims to
        accomplish. Goals, on the other hand, are broader statements of the
        desired outcomes or benefits of the project.
      </p>
      <p>
        For front-end engineers, objectives could include delivering a
        responsive and accessible user interface within a specific timeline,
        while goals may focus on improving user engagement or increasing
        conversions.
      </p>

      <h3>Scope</h3>
      <p>
        Project scope defines the boundaries of the project, specifying what
        work will be included and excluded. It helps prevent scope creep and
        ensures that the project stays on track.
      </p>
      <p>
        In front-end development, scope may include the features and
        functionalities to be implemented, the supported browsers and devices,
        and any performance or accessibility requirements.
      </p>

      <h3>Stakeholders</h3>
      <p>
        Stakeholders are individuals or groups who have an interest in the
        project's outcome or can influence its success. They may include
        clients, users, project managers, designers, back-end developers, and
        other team members.
      </p>
      <p>
        Front-end engineers need to collaborate with stakeholders to gather
        requirements, receive feedback, and ensure that the project meets their
        expectations.
