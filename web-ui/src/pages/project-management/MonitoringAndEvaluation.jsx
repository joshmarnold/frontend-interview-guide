        Project monitoring and evaluation are critical processes that help track
        project progress, measure performance, and ensure that project
        objectives are met. They involve collecting and analyzing data,
        comparing actual results against planned targets, and making informed
        decisions based on the insights gained. Front-end engineers play a vital
        role in monitoring and evaluating the performance of the user interface
        and the overall user experience.
