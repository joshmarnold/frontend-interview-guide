        Project management is the practice of initiating, planning, executing,
        controlling, and closing the work of a team to achieve specific goals
        and meet specific success criteria at the specified time. The primary
        challenge of project management is to achieve all of the project goals
        within the given constraints. This includes scope, time, and budget. The
        secondary—and more ambitious—challenge is to optimize the allocation of
        necessary inputs and apply them to meet pre-defined objectives. The
        frontend engineer, as a leader, plays a crucial role in managing
        projects and ensuring their successful delivery. They are responsible
        for coordinating the efforts of the frontend team, aligning the project
        with business objectives, and delivering high-quality products that meet
        user needs. The frontend engineer must be well-versed in project
        management methodologies, frameworks, and best practices to effectively
        lead and execute projects. They must also be skilled in planning,
        organizing, and communicating to ensure that projects are completed on
        time and within budget. This section covers various aspects of project
        management, including initiation, planning, execution, monitoring, and
        evaluation, as well as methodologies and frameworks that can be applied
        to frontend development projects.
