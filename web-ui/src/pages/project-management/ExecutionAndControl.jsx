      <p>
        Project execution and control involve the processes and activities
        required to manage and monitor the project's progress, ensure quality,
        and handle changes throughout the project lifecycle. It is essential for
        front-end engineers to understand these concepts to effectively
        contribute to the project's success.

      <h3>Change Management Plan</h3>
      <p>
        A change management plan outlines the processes and procedures for
        identifying, evaluating, and implementing changes to the project scope,
        requirements, or deliverables. It helps ensure that changes are properly
        assessed, approved, and communicated to all relevant stakeholders.
      </p>
      <p>
        In front-end development, changes may arise due to evolving user
        requirements, design iterations, or technical challenges. Having a
        well-defined change management plan helps minimize disruptions and
        ensures that changes are handled efficiently and effectively.
      </p>

      <h3>Project Management Software</h3>
      <p>
        Project management software tools are used to plan, organize, and track
        project activities, resources, and deliverables. They provide a
        centralized platform for collaboration, communication, and progress
        monitoring.
      </p>
      <p>
        Front-end engineers may use project management tools to track tasks,
        assign responsibilities, set deadlines, and communicate with team
        members. Popular project management tools include Jira, Asana, Trello,
        and Microsoft Project.
      </p>
      <p>
        These tools help streamline project execution, improve transparency, and
        facilitate effective communication among team members. They also provide
        valuable insights into project progress, resource utilization, and
        potential bottlenecks.
