      <p>
        Project planning is a critical phase where the project team defines the
        roadmap and the steps required to achieve the project's objectives. It
        involves identifying deliverables, setting milestones, allocating
        resources, and assessing potential risks and dependencies.
      </p>

      <h3>Quarterly Planning</h3>
      <p>
        Quarterly planning is a strategic approach that involves setting goals
        and objectives for a three-month period. It helps align project
        activities with the organization's overall strategy and ensures that
        progress is made towards long-term goals. Quarterly planning allows for
        regular review, adjustment, and prioritization of project initiatives.
      </p>

      <h3>OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)</h3>
      <p>
        OKRs is a goal-setting framework that defines ambitious objectives and
        measurable key results. It helps teams focus on high-impact goals, align
        their efforts, and track progress. OKRs encourage stretch goals, foster
        collaboration, and promote a culture of accountability and continuous
        improvement. Here's an example of how OKRs can be used in front-end
        development:
      </p>
      <p>Objective: Improve the performance of the web application</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Key Result: Reduce page load time by 20%</li>
        <li>Key Result: Increase Google Lighthouse performance score to 90</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Deliverables</h3>
      <p>
        Deliverables are the tangible or intangible outputs that the project
        aims to produce. In front-end development, deliverables may include user
        interface designs, functional prototypes, implemented features, and
        documentation.
      </p>

      <h3>Milestones</h3>
      <p>
        Milestones are significant points or events in the project timeline that
        mark the completion of key deliverables or phases. They help track
        progress and ensure that the project is on schedule. Examples of
        milestones in front-end development could be the completion of the
        initial design, the implementation of core features, or the successful
        integration with back-end services.
      </p>

      <h3>Budget</h3>
      <p>
        The project budget outlines the financial resources allocated for the
        project. It includes costs related to personnel, tools, licenses, and
        any other expenses necessary to complete the project. Front-end
        engineers should be aware of the budget constraints and make informed
        decisions about technology choices and resource utilization.
      </p>

      <h3>Resources</h3>
      <p>
        Resources refer to the people, tools, and materials required to execute
        the project. In front-end development, resources may include front-end
        developers, designers, project managers, development tools, libraries,
        and frameworks. Effective resource allocation and management are crucial
        for successful project delivery.
      </p>

      <h3>Risks</h3>
      <p>
        Risks are potential events or factors that could negatively impact the
        project's success. Front-end engineers should identify and assess risks
        related to technical challenges, dependencies, browser compatibility,
        performance issues, or external factors. Risk mitigation strategies
        should be developed to minimize their impact on the project.
      </p>

      <h3>Assumptions</h3>
      <p>
        Assumptions are factors that are considered to be true or certain
        without concrete evidence. In front-end development, assumptions may
        include the availability of certain technologies, the compatibility of
        third-party libraries, or the expected user behavior. It's important to
        document and validate assumptions to avoid potential issues later in the
        project.
      </p>

      <h3>Constraints</h3>
      <p>
        Constraints are limitations or restrictions that affect the project's
        scope, schedule, or resources. Common constraints in front-end
        development include browser support, device compatibility, performance
        requirements, or accessibility standards. Front-end engineers need to
        work within these constraints and find suitable solutions to deliver a
        successful project.
      </p>

      <h3>Dependencies</h3>
      <p>
        Dependencies are relationships between tasks, deliverables, or resources
        where one item relies on another. In front-end development, dependencies
        may exist between different features, modules, or integration points
        with back-end services. Identifying and managing dependencies is
        essential to ensure smooth project execution and avoid delays.
