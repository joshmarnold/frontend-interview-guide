  },
  {
    question: "How does the 'flex-shrink' property affect a flex item?",
    answer:
      "It determines the ability of a flex item to shrink if needed, to prevent overflow of the container.",

    question: "What is the 'flex-basis' property and how is it used?",
    answer:
      "It sets the initial main size of a flex item before the remaining space is distributed, specified as a length, percentage, or auto.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you explain the shorthand 'flex' property for flex items?",

      <p>
        If the following topics are new to you, I recommend watching the
        following videos to get a better understanding of CSS. If you're looking
        for a refresher or a deeper dive, these videos are also helpful. I think
        for these concepts, videos would be more helpful so that you can see the
        visual representation of the concepts. You will be expected to know
        these topics for the technical interview.

        <h3 style={{ margin: "0px" }}>Selectors</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Element selectors target elements by their tag name (e.g.,{" "}
            <code>p</code>, <code>div</code>).
          </li>

          <li>
            Class selectors target elements with a specific class (e.g.,{" "}
            <code>.my-class</code>).
          </li>
          <li>
            ID selectors target elements with a specific ID (e.g.,{" "}
            <code>#my-id</code>).
          </li>
          <li>
            Attribute selectors target elements based on their attributes (e.g.,{" "}
            <code>[type="text"]</code>).
          </li>
          <li>
            Pseudo-class selectors target elements based on a specific state
            (e.g., <code>:hover</code>, <code>:active</code>).
          </li>
          <li>
            Pseudo-element selectors target specific parts of an element (e.g.,{" "}
            <code>::before</code>, <code>::after</code>).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style={{ margin: "0px" }}>Display</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>display: block;</code> - Elements take up the full width
            available and start on a new line.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>display: inline;</code> - Elements only take up as much width
            as needed and do not start on a new line.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>display: inline-block;</code> - Elements behave like inline
            elements but can have a width and height.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>display: flex;</code> - Creates a flex container for flexible
            box layout.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>display: grid;</code> - Creates a grid container for grid
            layout.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style={{ margin: "0px" }}>Position</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>position: static;</code> - Default positioning, elements
            follow the normal document flow.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>position: relative;</code> - Elements are positioned relative
            to their normal position.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>position: absolute;</code> - Elements are positioned relative
            to their nearest positioned ancestor.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>position: fixed;</code> - Elements are positioned relative to
            the browser window.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>position: sticky;</code> - Elements are positioned based on
            the user's scroll position.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style={{ margin: "0px" }}>Specificity</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Specificity determines which styles are applied when multiple
            selectors target the same element.
          </li>
          <li>Inline styles have the highest specificity.</li>
          <li>IDs have higher specificity than classes and attributes.</li>
          <li>
            Classes and attributes have higher specificity than element
            selectors.
          </li>
          <li>The more specific selector takes precedence.</li>
          <li>
            <Specificity />
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style={{ margin: "0px" }}>Other Fundamental Concepts</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Box Model - Every element is composed of content, padding, border,
            and margin.
          </li>
          <li>
            CSS Units - Pixels (px), percentages (%), ems (em), rems (rem), and
            viewport units (vw, vh) are commonly used.
          </li>
          <li>
            Inheritance - Some CSS properties are inherited by child elements
            from their parent elements.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cascading - When multiple styles are applied to an element, the
            cascading rules determine which styles take precedence. The order of
            precedence is inline styles, IDs, classes, and elements and then the
            order in which the styles are declared.
          </li>
        </ul>
