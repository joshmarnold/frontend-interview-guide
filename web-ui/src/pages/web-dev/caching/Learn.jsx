      <p>
        Caching is a crucial aspect of web development that plays a significant
        role in optimizing performance and reducing the load on servers. It
        involves storing frequently accessed data or resources in a cache, which
        can be quickly retrieved when needed, instead of fetching them from the
        original source each time.
      </p>
      <h3>Frontend Caching</h3>
      <p>
        Frontend caching refers to the techniques and mechanisms used to cache
        data and resources on the client-side, typically in the web browser. It
        aims to minimize network requests and improve the responsiveness of web
        applications. Frontend caching can be implemented at different levels,
        such as browser caching, application-level caching, and using caching
        strategies like cache-first or network-first.
      </p>
      <p>
        Browser caching involves the web browser storing resources (e.g., HTML,
        CSS, JavaScript, images) locally on the client's machine. Subsequent
        requests for the same resources can be served from the browser cache,
        reducing the need for network requests. HTTP headers, such as
        Cache-Control and ETag, can be used to control browser caching behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
        Application-level caching in the frontend refers to caching data, API
        responses, or rendered components within the application code itself. It
        can be achieved using techniques like in-memory caching, local storage,
        or leveraging caching libraries and frameworks.
      </p>
      <h3>Backend Caching</h3>
      <p>
        Backend caching involves caching data and resources on the server-side
        to reduce the load on the server and improve response times. While
        backend caching is not the primary focus of frontend development
        interviews, it's still important to have a basic understanding of its
        concepts and techniques.
      </p>
      <p>
        Backend caching can be implemented at various levels, such as database
        caching, object caching, or using caching proxies like Redis or
        Memcached. It helps minimize the need for expensive computations,
        database queries, or external API calls by storing the results in a
        cache for faster retrieval.
