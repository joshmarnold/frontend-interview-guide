    question: "What is Time to First Byte (TTFB), and what does it measure?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        TTFB measures the time from making an HTTP request to receiving the
        first byte of a page. It's critical for assessing server responsiveness
        and contributes to faster page perception, enhancing user experience.
      </p>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "How can you improve TTFB on a website?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        Strategies include optimizing server performance, using CDNs, enabling
        keep-alive connections, and minimizing server-side processing through
        caching and database optimization.
      </p>
    ),
  },
  {
    question:
      "What role does caching play in web performance, and how can it be optimized?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        Caching reduces server load, bandwidth, and latency by storing file
        copies or data responses. Optimization includes setting proper cache
        headers, using browser caching, and server-side caching for dynamic
        content.

  {
    question:
      "What is First Contentful Paint (FCP), and why is it significant?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>
          This tracks how long it takes for the first piece of content to appear
          on the screen after a user navigates to a page. It's a key measure of
          a site's speed, reflecting how quickly users can see something on the
          page. Improving FCP means users are less likely to leave due to
          waiting, enhancing their overall experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if you navigate to a news website and the headline
          appears within 1.5 seconds, that's the site's FCP time. A faster FCP,
          like this, ensures users have a positive first impression of the
          website's performance.

    question:
      "What is the Critical Rendering Path, and how can it be optimized?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>
          The critical rendering path is about ensuring the most important parts
          of a website are visible first when someone visits a page. It
          prioritizes the quick loading and display of immediately visible
          content, allowing users to start interacting with the site faster.
        </p>
        <p>
          In technical terms, it's the sequence of steps the browser goes
          through to turn the site's code into the visual elements on the
          screen. This involves processing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to render
          the layout and content.
        </p>
        <p>
          To optimize this process, you should minimize file sizes, prioritize
          the loading of essential content, and defer less important resources
          until needed. This strategy enhances the user experience by making the
          main content accessible more quickly and keeping users engaged.
